Utilities extracted from my Flask applications.

The files are mostly independent from each other but may have dependencies on some
Flask extensions. Assume all files depend on Flask.

Below are included files and their dependencies.


app.py (helpers.py, Flask-Silk, Flask-HTMLBuilder)
decorators.py (helpers.py, Flask-Cache)
filters.py
interfaces.py (itsdangerous)
mimes.py
validators.py
helpers.py (Flask-HTMLBuilder, Flask-Mako)


Go through the sources and pick what you like for your app.
Personalization is priceless for those of us who choose not to wear straight jackets. :)


More documentation to come later.
