Utilities extracted from my Flask applications.

The files are mostly independent from each other but may have dependencies on some
Flask extensions. Assume all files depend on Flask.

Below is a mapping of files and their dependencies.

# this is a small but powerful interface to using SQLAlchemy without the Flask extension.
db.py           >  SQLAlchemy
app.py          >  helpers.py, Flask-Silk
decorators.py   >  helpers.py, Flask-Cache
filters.py      >  ''
interfaces.py   >  itsdangerous
mimes.py        >  ''
validators.py   >  ''
helpers.py      >  Flask-HTMLBuilder, Flask-Mako


Go through the sources and pick what you like for your app.
